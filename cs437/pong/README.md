# Pong (working title)
Pong game by Jeremy Elkayam, made in SFML

## Project Requirements
- ~~The game should be played in an 800x600 window. Changing the size of the window should be disabled
__(10%)__.~~
_Completed!_
- A well-defined game loop that coordinates game timing and event management __(20%)__.
- ~~A single player version should be implemented where the user controls a single paddle __(15%)__,
and the computer the other paddle __(15%)__.~~ _Completed!_
- ~~The paddle can be moved by keyboard or mouse (one method of control is sufficient). The paddle
of both the player~~ and the AI should move at a constant speed.
- ~~A ball should bounce of the top and bottom edge of the playfield and the direction of the ball should
change to the reflected direction __(15%)__.~~
_Completed!_
~~To add an element of uncertainty, a small random perturbation
could be added/subtracted from the reflected direction __(5%)__.~~
_Completed!_
- ~~A player scores when the ball hits the edge of the competitorsâ€™ side __(5%)__.~~
_Completed!_
- ~~The game starts with both players having zero points~~, and ends when one player reaches 11 
points. A message should be shown to indicate whether the player won or lost.  The player 
should have the option to restart the game or quit __(10%)__.
- ~~The current score should be shown in the window __(5%)__.~~ _Completed!_


### Completed Requirements
- 800x600 game window with resizing disabled
- Ball that bounces on contact with top and bottom of screen, with angle reflected
- Random perturbation ranging from -0.1 to 0.1 radians upon bouncing off the top/bottom of the screen
- Single player-controlled paddle that the ball can bounce off of.
- Players score a point when a ball hits the opposing side's edge.
- Both players start with 0 points.
- Game displays point values on-screen.

## Bonus Features
- None so far!

### Planned features/potential ideas and goals
- better AI (more realistic). Make it fuck up sometimes. Under or overshoot the ball.
It should be beatable without forcing it to have a much lower speed than the player's paddle.
  - Also: it should try to use all or none of its movement speed. None of this pressing and
  releasing the keys to make it seem slower or faster. I will get points docked if both paddles
  don't move at constant speed.
- Initial angle shouldn't skew toward 180 or 0 degrees (i.e. stright toward one of the
players). It makes the game boring
- Game should pause and wait for player input upon starting a new round, to allow players to
catch their breath and focus on the new round of play.
- Title Screen with adjustable options.
  - turn AI on/off for each side? i.e. 2 AI players, 2 human players, or one each
  - adjustable speed slider?
  - sounds on/off?
- cheesy sound effects?
- acceleration of paddle (the Paddle class already stores an unused acceleration
- When bouncing off of a paddle, a ball could have a deterministic perturbation, affected
by the magnitude and direction of the paddle's velocity.
